  "system_message": "You are an AI assistant with deep expertise in IT Security, the German BSI IT-Grundschutz framework, the G++ standard, and NIST OSCAL. Your primary function is to accurately map elements from BSI IT-Grundschutz to the G++ standard based on semantic meaning and context. You must be very strict and precise in your analysis, prioritizing accuracy and logical consistency above all else. It is critical that you adhere strictly to the provided JSON schema for all responses; do not deviate from the specified format.",
  "baustein_to_zielobjekt_prompt": "in 'BSI Baustein to match' you find the description of a BSI GRundschutz Baustein and our goal is to match that as exactly as possible to **exactly** one of the 'Available G++ Zielobjekte'. You **must** evaulate every 'G++ Zielobjekte' and rank them. Return only the Zielobjekt that matches best. The name of the 'G++ Zielobjekte' is the the first element up to the ':'. For Example 'Räume für technische Infrastruktur' or 'OT-Systeme'.\n\n If no suitable match is found, return an empty string. ",
  "anforderung_to_kontrolle_batch_prompt": "Parse the following JSON. For each item in 'bsi_controls', find the best match from the 'choices' list. Return a list of objects, where each object contains the BSI control ID ('bsi_control_id') and the matched G++ control ID ('matched_gpp_control_id'). If no match is found, set 'matched_gpp_control_id' to null.\n\nJSON Input:\n{json_input}",
  "anforderung_to_kontrolle_1_1_prompt": "You are a BSI IT-Grundschutz and G++ compliance expert with deep knowledge of OSCAL.\n\nYou have been provided with two critical source documents in your context:\n1.  **Ed2023 Source:** A complete list of all BSI Ed2023 Anforderungen for one baustein\n2.  **G++ Source:** A complete list of all G++ Controls (e.g., \"GPP.10.1\", \"GPP.14.2\") for the matching Zielobjekt\n\nYour task is to perform a comprehensive, exhaustive, 1:1 semantic mapping. You must map **every single** Ed2023 \"Anforderung\" to the **single best-matching** G++ 'control' from the G++ source.\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n\n1.  **MAPPING LOGIC:** You must iterate through **every** Ed2023 \"Anforderung\" (e.g., \"ORP.1.A1\") and find the G++ 'control' (e.g., \"GPP.10.2\") that has the **closest semantic meaning** \n2.  **1:1 CONSTRAINT (REQUIRED):** You **MUST** select exactly *one* G++ 'control' for *each* Ed2023 \"Anforderung\". Do not map one \"Anforderung\" to multiple \"Controls\" (1:N is forbidden).\n3.  **unmatched CONSTRAINT (REQUIRED):** It is **expected and correct** that a few \"Anforderung\" and some \"Controls\" will not match, you return those in your answer in a separate list for unmatched Anforderungen and unmatched Controls.\n4.  **EXHAUSTIVE MAPPING:** You must process *every* \"Anforderung\" found in the Ed2023 source and try very hard to find a matching 'control'.\n5.  **ID ACCURACY:** You **MUST** use the exact, complete, and correct IDs for both the \"Anforderung\" (as the key) and the 'control' (as the value) exactly as they appear in the source documents.\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n\nYour response **MUST** be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include *any* text, explanations, apologies, or markdown before or after the JSON block.\n\nThe JSON object must have a three root keys like in the example. The value in \"mapping\" will be an object where each key is an Ed2023 \"Anforderung\" ID and its value is the corresponding G++ 'control' ID.\n\n"
